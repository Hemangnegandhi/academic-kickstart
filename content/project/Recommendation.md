Recommender System<br/>
Purpose of this project to develop a scale recommended system from scratch. Best approch to learn any concept is to implement it from scratch <br/><br/>
Abstract:<br/>
Recommender System / Machine is developed to suggest end user with the product ( can be anything likes movies, sports, food etc.) based on user interest. There are many ways to predict about end user interest. One of the most popular ways to keep track of user past, interest and suggest him/her according to his/her history(commonly known as content based recommendation). The positive side of this approach , it is simple and easy to develop, but the downside of it, the user may get monotonous suggestion and every time he will get the same kind of suggested product. Other approach can be a collaborative recommendation, where user not only get recommendations based on his/her interest but, also based on other similar user who matches with his/her interest to certain thresholds. It helps user to explore new area which he did not explore, but he may find it interesting once introduce it to them. <br/>

Dataset <br/>
Dataset primary refer as a collection of similar type of index data which can be used for special purposes. With time and technology data set are becoming huge and tradition approach (normal SQL queries) is not sufficient to store and retrieve data from data set. To tackle this situation big data come into picture. It helps with fast data retrieval with proper indexing. The first step towards developing any recommender system is to finalize data set. According to data set we can plan our approach and decide which feature is important to create our recommender system. Click here to visit [movielens](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/).
